# kricke-track-protection

 The  project is to overcome the difficulties faced by cricketteam.
The major difficulties faced by the players during rainydays is,the
ball will not bounce and the player will miss the pitch.This can be
over come by using a technicalwork,which will reduce humanwork and
protect the ground from rain.This project will protect the groundfrom
getting wet and maintains the property constantly.When it  rains,
players will not get grip-ness to playthegame instantly.Hencetheyare
forced to protect the ground from rain,so they are insisted to protect
the ground using tarpaulin.The tarpaulin will cover the ground and
resist from getting wet.Thegreatest advantage of this system is
accuracy of raindropsensor,which activates the controller and
initiates the DCmotor to protect the track.
