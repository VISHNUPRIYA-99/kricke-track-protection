The major difficulties faced by the players during rainydays is,the
ball will not bounce and the player will miss the pitch.This can be
over come by using a technicalwork,which will reduce humanwork and
protect the ground from rain.This project will protect the groundfrom
getting wet and maintains the property constantly.When it  rains,
players will not get grip-ness to playthegame instantly.Hencetheyare
forced to protect the ground from rain,so they are insisted to protect
the ground using tarpaulin.The tarpaulin will cover the ground and
